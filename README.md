hi guys, here is a repo for us to commit our ideas to. we can share what kind of games we're interested in. 

I don't currently play any computer games or app games, but as a kid I use to love adventure type of games, like Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacles. Games where you can walk around and explore, and pick up things, etc.
